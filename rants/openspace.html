<h1>Openspaces</h1>
<p>Every once in a while I stumble upon a person who doesn't loathe openspace offices or even asks <q>what's wrong with them?</q></p>
<p>Let me <strike>fucking</strike> tell you what's wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This is a rant. Don't expect citations or hard scientific evidence everywhere.
    Although I'll keep adding links to be more annoying.</p>
<aside>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>I'm using <em>openspace</em> as shorthand for <em>open space office layout</em>.<br>
    For me this means every office space, regardless of its size or number of occupants, that isn't an enclosed room.<br>
    Enclosed offices &quot;housing&quot; more than two workers share a number of problems with openspace, but I call them <em>rotten compromise</em>. They're a bit better.

<h2>It's made of people</h2>
    <p>It sickens me to my stomach to even have to outline all the problems.</p>
<p>
    You're in a room full of people for most of your waking hours. <br>
    You are there to perform mental labour, requiring your intelligence and focus, to benefit your employer and yourself.<br>
    People are sophisticated life forms. People use oxygen. People have their own smell. Their own unique microbiome.<br>
    People exhale warm gas full of carbon dioxide, water vapour, odours.
    People spit saliva out of their mouth every time they speak. <strong>Wild rave party</strong> for bacteria and viruses!<br>
    People generate heat and secrete sweat. They need to eat and excrete. They get sick. They are sad. They're happy. They're excited or tired.<br>
    Human speech consists of powerful sound waves in broad frequency range with insanely high amplitudes. People move almost all the time, it's unnatural to remain motionless for extended periods.<br>
    People react strongly to other person's behaviour, gestures, mood and especially speech. That's molded by ages of evolution.
</p>
    <p>I'm not saying people are disgusting. They present technological challenge when put together under a roof ;)</p>
</p>
<h2>Ineffective</h2>
<p>Openspace offices are ineffective in <strong>almost</strong> every way imaginable.</p>
<h3>There is no privacy</h3>
<p>
    I've seen people astonished that I event speak about privacy at WORK. I feel very sorry for them. Signing up for work is not an approval for intrusion!<br>
    In openspace you are constantly either being watched, or feel being watched. Unless you <strong>like them to watch</strong>, that's a stress factor.<br>
    There is no personal space. There is no comfort (more of that later). These are very important for your long term health, well-being and mental performance.

<h3>Visual distractions</h3>
<h3>Auditorial distractions</h3>
<h3>Inadequate temperature</h3>
<h3>Inadequate light</h3>
<h3>Behaviour change</h3>
<h3>Fatigue</h3>
<h3>Openspace-specific adaptations are expensive</h3>
<h3>Adaptations don't fix the problem very well</h3>
